# Detection and disambiguating language instructions for a robot

This repository contains a slight modification to the original [AmbiK repository](https://github.com/cog-model/AmbiK-dataset) - a possibility to get uncertainty scores of LLM's prediction using one of estimation methods taken from [LM-polygraph](https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph). Currently works only with [KnowNo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01928) framework.
